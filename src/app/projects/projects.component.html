          This application allows users to view average reported wait times for
          local restaurants and bars. To create this application, I used Python
          Flask to develop the back-end API which connected to a PostgreSQL
          database to store user information, which ultimately reported wait
          times. To create the front end of the mobile application, I used React
          Native to connect the back end in order to display the results to the
          users.
